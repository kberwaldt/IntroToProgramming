                    I recently went on a trip to Playa Del Carmen in Mexico.  I had a great experience but more importantly took this great photo.  Check it Out!

                    I am excited and interested to learn more about coding.  Today is my first time actually logging into <a href="https://www.udacity.com">Udacity</a> after paying for it.  I know a little slow to get started but sometimes life (or lazyness) gets in the way.  So far so good and I am excited to jump into python to further my knowledge in DevOps.

                    Today I finally signed up for <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/intro-to-programming-nanodegree--nd000"> Udacity's Intro To Programming Nanodegree Program </a> after a ton of research through various blogs.  I believe the format will be perfect for my needs and I am excited to learn more.
